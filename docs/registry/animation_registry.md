# Animation Registry

## What is this?
This is where all animations are stored.

They are registered with an identifier and a supplier which will create a new instance of the AnimatonHolder.

## Examples
See [Timeless Heroes](https://github.com/Duzos/superhero/blob/master/src/main/java/mc/duzo/timeless/client/TimelessClient.java#L42)
